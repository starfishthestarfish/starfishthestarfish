### Hi! My name is Alex.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on becoming a front end developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java (Yes, this doesn't make sense with what I just said. But I am a student and that's my current course).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on apps created with React and JS/TS and creation of websites with CSS, JS, and HTML. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with JS :,D. I also don't know what's a pointer for in C++.
- 💬 Ask me about whatever you want! I'll try answering to the best of knowledge. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🎵 Fun fact: I also produce music and sing. Being an artist is my biggest dream.
