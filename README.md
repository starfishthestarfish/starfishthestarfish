### Hi! My name is Alex.

- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 🔭 I'm working on becoming a front end developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on apps created with React and JS/TS and creation of websites with CSS, JS, and HTML. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with JS.
- 📖 I know a little bit of everything, but don't ask me what are pointers for. 
- 💬 Ask me about whatever you want! I'll try answering to the best of my knowledge. But I am slow to answer.
- 🎵 Fun fact: I also produce music and sing. Being an artist is my biggest dream.
